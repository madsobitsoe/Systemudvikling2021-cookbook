Select the installer of your choice (in the Windows case you can select the full installer (if you are offline or a minimal installer - if you are online - that downloads during the installation):


![]({{ site.url }}/mysql/install_windows/images/install_windows_2.png)


In the installation wizard select Custom installation and click next:

In the next window deselect MySQL for Visual Studio (unless you for some reason have Visual Studio installed on your computer) in the right column and click the left-arrow so that it looks like:

![]({{ site.url }}/mysql/install_windows/images/install_windows_4.png)


and click next and execute….
NB! click “try again” if the download for some reason fails.
(Hint! Otherwise go back to the web page and download the full installer)

It should now look like

Again: Click next and then execute

And after some minutes you should see:

Complete the installation (untick that you want to start the workbench and shell unless you are very curious :-) ) by clicking the finish button.
