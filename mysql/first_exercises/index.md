# Ensuring MySQL is set up correctly through MySQL Workbench

Open MySQL Workbench. In the main window, under "MySQL Connections", you should see one database:

![]({{ site.url }}/mysql/first_exercises/images/setup_1.png)




# Users in MySQL

For the course it will be okay to use the root user for everything.

In a real production environment, you would create specific users and designate/administer their privileges for specific databases.

# Creating a database

To familiarize ourselves with MySQL and MySQL workbench, we will create a simple database, to manage a pet store.

To create our first database, start by clicking the "Create a new schema in the connected server"-button:

![]({{ site.url }}/mysql/first_exercises/images/new_schema.png)


Fill in a name for our new database, then click the small "apply"-button. I call my database "PetStore":

![]({{ site.url }}/mysql/first_exercises/images/new_schema_1.png)

Now a window with a small piece of code should pop up.
This is an SQL query (DDL to be exact), that will create a new database (schema).
Click Apply to execute the query.
![]({{ site.url }}/mysql/first_exercises/images/new_schema_2.png)


Now click the "Schemas"-tab. You should be able to see our newly created database, PetStore!

![]({{ site.url }}/mysql/first_exercises/images/new_schema_3.png)


We can not do much with just a database. We need tables, in order to store data.


# Creating a table in our database





<!-- 2) Create a new user -->

<!-- Currently, only the root user (administrator) for the entire MySQL program exists. -->
<!-- We will now create a user -->

<!-- Click the one database from the screenshot above. -->
