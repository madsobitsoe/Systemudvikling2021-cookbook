Programming Exercises

The exercise follows here:

*1. A Patient class
Create a class for managing patients ie. the Patient class, with the following private attributes:

- first name
- last name
- CPR number (bonus: how do you ensure that the CPR is written correctly?)
- telephone number (bonus: how do you ensure that this is a valid telephone number?)
- E-mail (bonus: how do you ensure that this is a valid email address?)

Add the following public get- and set-methods: (In IntelliJ IDEA you can use Alt-insert and get the Generate menu that helps you) 

- getFirstname()
- setFirstName(newName)
- getLastName()
- setLastName()
- getCPR()
- setCPR(newCPR)
- getPhoneNumber()
- setPhoneNumber(newPhoneNumber)
- getEmail()
- setEmail(newEmail)
- getAge() - (this attribute is calculated from the CPR number, so there are no setter for this, and no private attribute)

2. Write a main method that exhibits the correct functioning of the patient class (create new patients, retrieve data from the patients, modify attributes of a patient, etc).
3. Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the patient class in task 1
4. Create an Employee class that represents an employee at the health clinic. An employee has the following attributes 
- First name
- Last name
- Employee id eg mb001 and mb002
- Job description eg doctor, nurse, secretary, physical therapist, chiropractor, smoking cessation consultant or psychologist
- Scheduled days off*
