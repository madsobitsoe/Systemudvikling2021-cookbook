- [Week 1](#week-1)


## Week 1
### Task 2
> Make a program that calculates the cost of an admission of X days length to the price Y per day.
### Task 3
> Create a program that tells a patient whether his blood percentage (Links to an external site.) requires attention.  Hints? Java if documentation (Links to an external site.)
### Task 4
> Create a program that registers patient data: Name and CPR number and address, and determines the patient age and his/her gender
> 1. Create a new Java Project in IntelliJ
> 2. Use the “Console Application” template
> 3. In the programs main-method, create variables to store patient data. Name, CPR and Address. Consider what data types to use.
> 4. Using the scanner class, ask the user to input Patient data: Name, CPR and Address.
> 5. Determine the age of the patient
> 6. Determine the assigned gender of the patient
> 7. Print out the information to the console

### Task 5

>
> Ensure that:
>
> - A name can only consist of Letters, not numbers.
> - A name is at least a first- and last name
> - A CPR follows the format ddmmyy-XXXX
> - If the input patient data does not live up to the requirements, notify the user by printing a message.
>
> - If the data fulfills the requirements, print out the patient data, age and assigned gender as in task 4.
> - Consider using methods to perform your validation.
>
> - *Bonus requirement*: Check that the CPR number is valid with Mod11. (https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulus_11 (Links to an external site.)) (https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPR-nummer#Kontrolciffer_(det_gamle_CPR-nummer) (Links to an external site.))
